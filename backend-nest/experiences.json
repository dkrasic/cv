Second, greenfield project for telemedical assistance tool in Zendesk. I led the front-end implementation, enriching the default Zendesk functionality with custom applications. These applications were added using iFrames and were living under the common monorepository. Third, the pilot project for public e-prescriptions (GERDA). GERDA was designed to digitize the entire public prescription flow in a specific region (Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg): from issuing a prescription to receiving it, on a mobile application, and redeeming it in a local pharmacy. In my role, I managed the project from the beginning of the implementation to testing and release, including the implementation of the medication database coming from an external library.\n\nOverall, I continuously improved the products by tracking technical insufficiencies and monitoring their performance. I worked closely with UI/UX designers, product managers, and other developers. In my role, I helped the company to provide accessible, high-quality healthcare services to doctors and healthcare providers and played a key role in the growth-led strategy.",
